# 1. Introduction

## 1.1 Purpose

The purpose of this document is to define the **Software Requirements Specification (SRS)** for the Educational Platform Interface and its registration modules. The platform is designed as a **public-facing web application** built using **native HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**, without external supervision features.

This specification provides a precise description of the platform’s **functional and non-functional requirements**, focusing exclusively on the modules under discussion:

- The **Platform Introduction Interface** (overview, policies, recognitions, and contribution options).
- The **Registration modules** (for schools, students, and teachers).
- The **School Profiles and Performance Overview**.
- The **Support and Donation mechanisms**.

The main objectives of this SRS are to:

- Establish a **clear understanding** between stakeholders (administrators, developers, contributors, and end users) regarding the system’s capabilities.
- Provide a **technical foundation** for implementation in alignment with international standards of software engineering.
- Ensure the platform remains **scalable, secure, and user-friendly**, while meeting the needs of the **general public** (students, teachers, school founders, and supporters).
- Serve as a **reference document** for future integration of this platform into the broader parent system.

## 1.2 Scope

The platform under specification serves as a **dedicated module** within a larger educational ecosystem. Its scope is limited to the **introduction, registration, profile, and support features**, without covering supervision, classroom management, or academic operations.

Specifically, this platform will provide:

- A **public introduction interface** that communicates the mission, vision, policies, achievements, and opportunities for contribution.
- **Electronic registration services** for schools, students, and teachers.
- **School profiles** with basic information and performance reporting.
- A **support and donation mechanism** enabling contributions to the platform, individual schools, or study circles.

The platform will be developed using **native HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**, ensuring lightweight performance, broad compatibility, and straightforward maintainability. It will comply with **W3C standards** and be optimized for multilingual support, with Arabic as the primary language.

This SRS does not address:

- Classroom supervision or attendance management.
- Curriculum development or e-learning functionalities.
- Any external modules outside the specified features.

The platform is designed to remain modular and **integrable into a parent system** through future API or service-based extensions.

### 5.3 Functional Flow Diagrams

**Examples of system workflows (to be included as diagrams in the final document):**

1. **School Registration Flow:**  
   User → Fills Registration Form → System Validates Data → Stores in Database → Generates Reference ID → Displays Confirmation.

2. **Student Registration Flow:**  
   Guardian → Inputs Student Info → System Validates → Stores Data → Sends Confirmation (Screen + Email/SMS).

3. **Donation Process Flow:**  
   Donor → Selects Support Type → Inputs Payment Info → System Validates Transaction → Records Donation → Issues Receipt.

(_Note: Actual diagrams should be drawn using UML or BPMN tools, but descriptions are included here for documentation consistency._)
